<h1 style="text-align: center;">Quantum Computing</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster[a] than any modern "classical" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or "quantum bit"), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two "basis" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly. </p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).

<p style="text-align: justify;">In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best known classical algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems unsolvable by a classical computer in any reasonable amount of time. This concept of extra ability has been called "quantum supremacy". While such claims have drawn significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited.  </p>

<ol>
  <li>Just as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information.</li>
  <li>The same term qubit is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model.</li>
  <li>A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1.</li>
  <li>A qubit is described by a state, and two states often written |0⟩ and |1⟩ serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Quantum states |0⟩ and |1⟩ belong to a vector space, meaning they can be multiplied by constants and added together to form a valid quantum state.</li>
  <li>Such a combination is known as a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩.</li>
  <li>A two-dimensional vector mathematically represents a qubit state.</li>
  <li>Physicists use Dirac notation for quantum mechanical linear algebra, writing |ψ⟩ 'ket psi' for a vector labeled ψ.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory that describes the behavior of nature at and below the scale of atoms. It is the foundation of all quantum physics, which includes quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.</p>
